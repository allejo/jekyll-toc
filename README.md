# Jekyll Pure Liquid Table of Contents

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allejo/jekyll-toc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/allejo/jekyll-toc)

GitHub Pages can't run custom Jekyll plug-ins so when generating Tables of Contents (TOCs), you're stuck with either a JavaScript solution or using kramdown's `{:toc}` option. However, by using `{:toc}`, you are forced to have that code next to your actual markdown and you can't place it in a layout. This means _every_. _single_. _post_. will need to have the snippet. If you choose the JavaScript approach, that's perfectly fine but what if JS is disabled on the someone's browser or your page is just _really_ long and it becomes inefficient.

Instead, I wrote this solution entirely in Liquid and can be used as an `{% include %}` in any website you want, in any layout you want. Want to see it in action? Here are some awesome websites that I know of using this solution :heart:.

For more information regarding how this include works, [read the blog post](https://allejo.io/blog/a-jekyll-toc-in-liquid-only/).

## Usage

Alright, so how do you use it?

1. Download the latest [`toc.html`](/_includes/toc.html) file
2. Toss that file in your `_includes` folder.
3. Use it in your template layout where you have `{{ content }}` which is the HTML rendered from the markdown source with this liquid tag:

   ```liquid
   {% include toc.html html=content %}
   ```

## Parameters

This snippet is highly customizable. Here are the available parameters to change the behavior of the snippet.

| Parameter  |  Type  | Default | Description |
| ---------  | :----: | :-----: | ----------- |
| `html`     | string | <sup>*</sup> | the HTML of compiled markdown generated by kramdown in Jekyll |
| `sanitize` | bool   | false  | when set to true, the headers will be stripped of any HTML in the TOC |
| `class`    | string | ''     | a CSS class assigned to the TOC; concat multiple classes with '.' |
| `id`       | string | ''     | an ID to be assigned to the TOC |
| `h_min`    | int    | 1      | the minimum TOC header level to use; any heading lower than this value will be ignored |
| `h_max`    | int    | 6      | the maximum TOC header level to use; any heading greater than this value will be ignored |
| `ordered`  | bool   | false  | when set to true, an ordered list will be outputted instead of an unordered list |
| `item_class` | string | ''   | add custom class for each list item; has support for `%level%` placeholder, which is the current heading level |

<sup>*</sup> This is a required parameter

## Performance

The performance impact of this snippet on your site is pretty negligible. The stats below were gotten from Jekyll's `--profile` option.

```
Filename                              | Count |      Bytes |    Time

_includes/toc.html                    |   813 |    524.17K |  6.422

# performance on the "Minimal Mistakes" Jekyll theme
_includes/toc.html                    |    94 |     29.43K |  0.413
